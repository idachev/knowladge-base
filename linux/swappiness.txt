vm.swappiness is a tunable kernel parameter that controls how much the
kernel favors swap over RAM. At the source code level, itâ€™s also defined
as the tendency to steal mapped memory. A high swappiness value means
that the kernel will be more apt to unmap mapped pages. A low swappiness
value means the opposite, the kernel will be less apt to unmap mapped
pages. In other words, the higher the vm.swappiness value, the more the
system will swap.

Edit:
sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf

Search for vm.swappiness and change its value as desired.
If vm.swappiness does not exist, add it to the end of the file like so:

vm.swappiness=10

To change the swappiness value a temporary change (lost on reboot) 
with a swappiness value of 10 can be made with:
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10

To view the curent value:
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness
