To be able to share one ssh-agent instance between all your logins use this in .zshrc:

# add keychain ssh-agent variables
keychain -q ~/.ssh/id_dsa_a
. ~/.keychain/$HOST-sh
. ~/.keychain/$HOST-sh-gpg

Also this is helpfull for cron jobs:
30 02 * * * . /home/<user>/.keychain/*-sh && . /home/<user>/.keychain/*-sh-gpg && /usr/bin/env python ...

Or just put these into the script if it is not a python but sh/bash/zsh:
. /home/<user>/.keychain/*-sh
. /home/<user>/.keychain/*-sh-gpg

Know that in cron session there is no $HOST env so I use * in above calls.
