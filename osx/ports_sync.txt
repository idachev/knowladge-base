1. Check out a working copy of the ports tree to some place on your  
hard disk, such as to your home directory:

svn co http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/trunk/dports ~/dports

2. Edit the file /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf. Comment out  
the line starting with "rsync://" and add a new line pointing to your  
working copy, in URL form, e.g.:

file:///Users/rschmidt/dports
